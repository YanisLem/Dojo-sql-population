## Ex 1

#​ Create a table named friends with three columns.

id that stores INTEGER
name that stores TEXT
the birthday that stores DATE
​
# Beneath your current code, add Jane Doe to friends.
Her birthday is on May 30th, 1990.
​
# Add two of your friends to the table.
Insert an id, name, and birthday for each of them
(name : Clara Doe / Jhon Doe)
​​
# Jane Doe just got married! Her new last name is “Smith”.
​
# Add a new column named email.
​
Jane Smith’s email is jane@wildcodeschool.fr
​
# Wait, Clara Doe is not a real person.

Remove her from friends.​
SELECT * FROM friends;
​

## EX2
​# What is the largest population size for Gabon in this dataset?
# What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?
# What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?
# How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?
## What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?
## Note: it’s okay to figure out the difference by hand after pulling the correct data.
